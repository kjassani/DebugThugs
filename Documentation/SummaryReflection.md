# Project Status Report: Social Media Platform Clone Development

## Introduction

As we reach Milestone 4 of our development cycle for the Discord clone project, it's essential to pause and reflect on our progress, processes, and the quality of our work. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of where we are in the project, how our chosen processes are functioning, and the measures we've taken to ensure the quality of our source code.

## Project Progress

The project's general flow has been positive, with the team doing well to produce the clone if Discord. We have successfully established a foundational structure for the application, including user interface components and functions.

However, we encountered significant delays in making the database fully functional. This setback impacted our schedule and influenced our development, but the team has been proactive in finding solutions to mitigate these delays.

Another challenge was our initial oversight in utilizing GitHub's workflow to its fullest potential, specifically in managing pull requests. This issue led to some confusion and inefficiencies in our code integration process and decreased organization among code and pushes from the individual work done. We have since revised our approach, adopting a more disciplined use of branches and pull requests, which has significantly improved our workflow and collaboration.

# Process Evaluation

## Changes Needed

To further improve our efficiency and effectiveness, we propose the following changes:

Enhanced Planning for Database Integration: Allocate more time for database design and implementation phases, incorporating buffer periods for unexpected challenges.

Strict Adherence to GitHub Workflow: Implement mandatory review processes for all pull requests, ensuring that no code is merged without proper review and testing.

## Quality Assurance

Ensuring the quality of our source code has been a priority from the outset. We have implemented several measures to maintain high standards.

### Code Reviews: 

Every piece of code is subjected to peer review before merging. This process not only catches bugs early but also promotes knowledge sharing and ensures coding standards are upheld.


### Automated Testing: 

We've integrated continuous integration (CI) tools to automate our testing process. This ensures that all code commits are tested, and potential issues are identified and resolved promptly.


### Debugging Sessions: 

Regular debugging sessions are held to address any issues identified during testing. These sessions have been invaluable in maintaining the overall health of our codebase.


### Improvements in Quality:

To further enhance the quality of our source code, we have taken additional steps, including:

Incorporating static code analysis tools to automatically scan our code for common errors and potential security issues.
Code Refactoring, dedication to regular code refactoring ensures our codebase remains clean, understandable, and maintainable.

# Conclusion

Despite the challenges encountered, our team remains on track in the development of the Discord clone. The problems we faced have been valuable learning opportunities, leading to improvements in our processes and workflows. Our commitment to quality assurance through rigorous reviewing, testing, and debugging practices has laid a solid foundation for a high-quality application. As we move forward, we will continue to refine our processes and implement the necessary changes to ensure the success of our project.
